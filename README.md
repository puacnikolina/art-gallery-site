# Simple Artist Portfolio 🎨  

Welcome to **Simple Artist Portfolio**, a small project created while learning **HTML & CSS**.  

## Project Description  
This project was developed as a practice exercise to explore web development fundamentals. It is a **static website** with no JavaScript (yet!). The site serves as an **artist's homepage**, featuring an **art gallery** and an **autobiography**.  

All the content and design are created for learning purposes and do not represent a real-world portfolio.  

## Features

- 🖼️ **Gallery Showcase** – Displays the artist's work.  
- 📝 **Biography Section** – Presents information about the artist.  

## Future Plans

- 🎭 **Improved Gallery** – Better styling and layout options.  
- 🔧 **More Customization** – Refining typography, colors, and overall design.
